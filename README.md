# Seasonal Escapes

In this project, our team designed a website which allows users to search for vacation destinations based on a desired climate. Currently, travelers often spend hours trying to decide where to go. We eliminate the need to spend hours researching by allowing users to search for travel destinations based on the climate they're interested in. We then return several potential destinations with both the current temperature and the cheapest flight so that users can decide on a destination that matches both their weather preference and their budget.
