# Seasonal Escapes

In this project, our team designed an website which allows users to search for vacation destinations based on the type of climate they are looking for. Currently, travelers often spend hours trying to decide where to go. We eliminate that problem by allowing users to search for travel destinations based on the climate they're interested in. We then return several places with the current temperature and the cheapest flight, so that users can decide on a destination that matches both their weather preference and their budget.
